// THE ASYNC-ACTION DANCE — `action()` from components/button.js, as a hook — plus the one place
// butchr's button vocabulary is reconciled with LaunchPad's.
//
// Every async control in butchr repeats the same four steps: disable the button, run the call,
// toast the outcome, re-enable. The vanilla `action()` owned that, and a hand-rolled `Button()`
// owned the `.btn` markup. LaunchPad's `Button` now owns the markup (RFC §7.2: **Direct**), so
// what is left here is the dance — and one behaviour that had to change, deliberately.
//
// >>> IMPORT THIS AS `"./button.tsx"`, WITH THE EXTENSION. <<< The vanilla `components/button.js`
// is still here — three vanilla modules (views/task.js, views/projects.js,
// components/project-modals.js) still build buttons through it — so `"./button.js"` resolves to
// THAT file under both `tsc` and `bun build`. Same rule as chips.tsx; see its header. Phase 4d
// deletes button.js and the specifiers can go back to being extensionless.
//
// >>> `restoreOnSuccess` IS GONE, AND ITS ABSENCE IS THE FIX. <<<
// The vanilla `action()` left the button DISABLED on success and relied on `render()` to destroy
// the node. Its own header said so: "action() leaves it disabled and relies on the re-render to
// discard the node. This is NOT cosmetic: render() is async … so there is a real window in which
// an enabled, re-clickable button is still mounted." cto-panel.js opted OUT of that (its private
// `btn()` re-enabled before re-rendering), and the flag existed only to keep both behaviours
// byte-identical through the Phase-2 unification.
//
// Under React NOTHING DESTROYS THE NODE. A refresh re-runs a fetch; the button reconciles in
// place. So "leave it disabled" is no longer a default that a rebuild tidies up — it is a
// permanently dead control. Both call sites therefore collapse onto the behaviour cto-panel
// already had: always re-enable, in a `finally`. The double-click window the flag guarded is
// closed by `inFlight` instead, which is the guarantee the disabled attribute was standing in for.
//
// The other two flags survive, because they encode real, differing intent:
//   renderOnError  — cto-panel re-fetches on FAILURE too (its render() sat in a `finally`).
//                    The default does not: it leaves the view alone so an inline error stays on
//                    screen next to a retryable button.
//   errorFallback  — cto-panel toasted `e.message || "failed"`; the default toasts a bare
//                    `e.message`. They diverge on a thrown non-Error or an empty message.

// ---------- the variant map ----------
//
// LaunchPad's `Button` ships five variants — default | primary | destructive | minimal | picker —
// read out of the installed package, not guessed. butchr's `.btn` classes map onto them cleanly
// EXCEPT for one, and the exception is not laziness:
//
//   .btn                      → variant="primary"     (both are #425eff; style.css's alias block
//                                                      already proves they are the same token)
//   .btn.ghost                → variant="minimal"
//   .btn.danger               → variant="destructive"
//   .btn.ghost.danger-outline → variant="destructive" + `.btn-outline`   ← LaunchPad's destructive
//                                                      is FILLED; there is no outline treatment
//   .btn.xs / .btn.ghost.xs   → size="small"
//
// `.btn-outline` is ADDITIVE. LaunchPad's `Button` composes whatever `className` it is given onto
// its own style output, so the component keeps its geometry, focus ring and hover/press `data-*`
// attributes and butchr overrides only `background`/`border`/`color`. style.css is imported LAST
// (main.tsx), so the override lands. This is RFC §7.1's posture applied at the variant level:
// LaunchPad's component, butchr's one missing semantic.
//
// `.btn.success` (green, `--merged`) IS HERE AS OF PHASE 4d, together with its CSS rule — which is
// the condition the previous phase set for adding it. LaunchPad has no success-coloured variant, so
// like `.btn.ghost.danger-outline` it is `primary` plus one additive class that overrides only the
// fill. Its call sites are the affirmative half of every feedback surface — Approve & merge, Approve
// spec, Approve plan, Submit spec, Send answer, Nudge, and the picker's "Register this folder".
//
//   .btn.success → variant="primary" + `.btn-success`
